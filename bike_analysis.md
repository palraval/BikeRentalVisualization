## Starting Station Popularity for Summer 2023

The first conclusion that can be drawn from this visualization is that Grove St PATH is the most common starting station for all the summer months(June - September). August seems to be the month when the Grove St PATH station is the most popular with a count of 5204. On the flip side of this, Marin Light Trail seems to be ranked the 10th most popular starting station in the summertime. In general, there does not seem to be much variation in terms of the names of the most popular stations for the summertime months. This means that the most popular starting stations remain the most popular ones for the duration of the summer. 

The displayed interactive map shows that the most popular starting stations tend to border the Eastern coast of New Jersey next to the Hudson River. A possible reason for this trend might be due to the fact that people like to go to sources of water when the weather is hot. More travelers to the New Jersey coast means more people will be renting bikes at these locations. 


## Ending Station Popularity for Summer 2023

Grove St PATH is also the most common ending station. Given the fact that this station is both the most popular starting and ending station, one conclusion that can be drawn is that it's probably located at some sort of hub that is extremely popular and easily accessible for people. August is also the month when Grove St PATH is the most popular ending station with a count of 5799. Newport PATH is the ranked 10th in popularity in September, but the remaining summer months have Marin Light Rail has the lowest popularity value in the top 10. 

The interactive map shows ending station activity in both the Eastern and Western side of the Hudson River. This indicates that there is some level of traveling activity that occurs from the two sides of the Hudson River. However, it does not seem like using bikes is a preferred source of transportation for traveling from one side of the Hudson River to the other. Most of the activity occurs on the Eastern side, which is also where the most activity for the starting stations was. This indicates people rent bikes mostly to travel along the Eastern coast of New Jersey.
